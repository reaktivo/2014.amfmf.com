    ##How to get there

    Groups of 4 can take a taxi libre from the border to the venue for 250
    pesos or around 20 dollars. Those wanting a cheaper public transportation
    option can take a a taxi shuttle that will only cost 14 pesos.

    For this option, walk or take a taxi(50 pesos) to a street called Madero
    between 5th and 6th street in downtown (very close to Mous Tache bar).
    Then hop on the White and Yellow Taxis (they look like vans) for the La Gloria -
    Rosarito Route. You can be dropped off right in front of the venue. Just make
    sure you tell the driver where you’re going so he can tell you where to get off.
